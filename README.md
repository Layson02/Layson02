I am a Computer Science student from Brazil with a deep passion for technology. My hands-on experience in assembling and maintaining desktop and notebook computers has provided me with strong problem-solving skills and a keen attention to detail.

Currently, I am deepening my studies in **Python, Java, JavaScript, and CSS**, with the goal of also learning C#. I am also studying **Prompt Engineering for AI** to better understand the interaction between people and intelligent systems. I am a curious, dedicated, and adaptable person, always looking to learn and take on new challenges.
